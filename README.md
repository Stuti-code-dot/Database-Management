# PSI_AUG

## 📌 Project Overview
The **PSI_AUG** project demonstrates a complete **data pipeline** — from raw data storage and SQL-based transformations to interactive visualization in **Tableau**.  
The goal was to design and implement a solution for querying, analyzing, and visualizing key business metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Store and organize structured datasets in SQL databases.
- Perform **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** operations using **T-SQL**.
- Create **optimized queries** for fast data retrieval and reporting.
- Build interactive dashboards in **Tableau** for decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL Server** – for data storage and query execution.
- **T-SQL** – for data transformation, aggregation, and performance tuning.
- **Tableau** – for visualization and dashboard design.
- **CSV / flat files** – for raw data input.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Normalized database schema** for efficient data storage.
- **Parameterized queries** for dynamic filtering.
- **Aggregated views** to simplify reporting.
- **Interactive Tableau dashboards** with filters, KPIs, and drill-down capabilities.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Database Setup**
   - Import scripts from the `Sql_Databases` folder into your SQL Server instance.
   - Run schema and data insert scripts in order.

2. **Tableau Setup**
   - Open the Tableau workbook from the `Tableau Solution` folder.
   - Connect it to your local or server-hosted database.

3. **Explore Dashboards**
   - Use filters and interactive elements to explore KPIs and visualizations.

## 📈 Example Insights
- Real-time sales and performance tracking.
- Trend analysis over time.
- Regional and product-level breakdowns.
